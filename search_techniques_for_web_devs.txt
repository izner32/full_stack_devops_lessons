// LESSON 2 - MASTERING SEARCH

// LESSON 2.1 - GOOGLE SEARCH 
example: should i use autoprefixer, google can't understand this and the results are plain old, fix?

// to find an exact match use qoutes
"error [object object]" gatsby // with this type search we're telling google to look for exact match of error [object object] that is related to gatsby

// filtering search results 
author gatsby // if this is the only thing we typed, top answer would lead you to the author of "The Great Gatsby" which is something we do not want, what we want is author of gatsby.js
author gatsby -fitzgerald // now it wouldn't produce any result related to fitzgerald
// use -"this for multiline filter"

// specifying the result to be mostly about specific site 
javascript date site:developer.mozilla.org // result would only be published articles by mozilla about dates on javascript

// when you want to search something related to what you want 
related:reactjs.org // this would return not reactjs.org but related to reactjs

// using logical operator when searching 
intitle:
allintitle:
intext:
allintext:
inurl:
allinurl:

// best practice used by the instructor
step 1: add the site or technology to the end of a search to narrow it down - typically, "mdn"
step 2: add entire error messages inside quotation marks to find specific hits 
step 3: if step 2 doesnt work, specialyl if there's a path that's unique to your local computer, replace some of the quoted error with asterisks to indicate wildcards 
step 4: type out verbose search string when you're looking or something specific 

// LESSON 2.2 - FILTER BY PUBLISHING DATE - useful when searching for best practices 
go to tools - past year
3 years and above is already an old way of doing things in web, make sure to filter your searches into past year 
- check the date and updated date
