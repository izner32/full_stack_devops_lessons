// FULL OF ERRORS - LESSON 1.1 - REACT WITH CSS MODULES WITHOUT EJECTING - create react app with css modules 
step 1: go to correct directory path 
step 2: in terminal type: npm install 
step 3: in terminal type: npm run start 
step 4: npm install -g create-react-app 
step 4.1(needed in windows): run powershell as administrator (powershell Start-Process powershell -Verb runAs) -> set-executionpolicy remotesigned
step 5: npx create-react-app css_module --scripts-version custom-react-scripts

// LESSON 2.1 - INTRODUCTION TO CSS MODULES - everything we've been doing is just for a single page 
- each module has its own css style (you could think of this as each element has its own css style, omy)
- e.g. 
    background has its own css - background.js/background.css
    title has its own css - titles.js/title.css 
    grid has its own css - grid.js/grid.css 
        grid item has its own css gridItem.js/gridItem.css 
    rocket has its own css - rocket.js/rocket.css 


// LESSON 2.2 - INITIAL DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - .js are the react component, where you code jsx 
step 1: in src -> create folders "background", "title", "grid" and "rocket"
step 2: create background.js, title.js, (grid.js, gridItem.js), rocket.js in their respective directories 
step 3: create .css for each corresponding .js files (ex. background.css)
step 4: copy the default template of App.js into each of the component 

// LESSON 2.3 - ADD COMPONENTS TO THE APP 
step 1: paste these into public/index.html
